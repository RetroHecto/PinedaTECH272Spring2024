        <h3>Early life and education</h3>
        <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>

        <p>Denzel Hayes Washington Jr. was born in Mount Vernon, New York, on <time datetime="1954-12-28">December 28, 1954</time>. His mother, Lennis &quot;Lynne&quot;, was a beauty parlor owner and operator born in Georgia and partly raised in Harlem, New York. His father, Denzel Hayes Washington Sr., a native of Buckingham County, Virginia, was an ordained Pentecostal minister, who was also an employee of the New York City Water Department, and worked at a local S. Klein department store.</p>
        
        <p>Washington attended Pennington-Grimes Elementary School in Mount Vernon until <time datetime="1968">1968</time>. When he was 14, his parents divorced and his mother sent him to the private preparatory school Oakland Military Academy in New Windsor, New York. Washington later said, &quot;That decision changed my life, because I wouldn't have survived in the direction I was going. The guys I was hanging out with at the time, my running buddies, have now done maybe 40 years combined in the penitentiary. They were nice guys, but the streets got them.&quot; After Oakland, he attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida, from <time datetime="1970">1970</time> to <time datetime="1971">1971</time>.</p>
        
        <p>He was interested in attending Texas Tech University: &quot;I grew up in the Boys Club in Mount Vernon, and we were the Red Raiders. So when I was in high school, I wanted to go to Texas Tech in Lubbock just because they were called the Red Raiders and their uniforms looked like ours.&quot; Instead, he earned a BA in Drama and Journalism from Fordham University in <time datetime="1977">1977</time>. At Fordham, he played collegiate basketball as a guard under coach P. J. Carlesimo. After a period of indecision on which major to study and taking a semester off, Washington worked as creative arts director of the overnight summer camp at Camp Sloane YMCA in Lakeville, Connecticut. He participated in a staff talent show for the campers and a colleague suggested he try acting.</p>
        
        <p>Returning to Fordham that fall with a renewed purpose, Washington enrolled at the Lincoln Center campus to study acting, where he was cast in the title roles in Eugene O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s <em>The Emperor Jones</em> and Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Othello</em>. He then attended graduate school at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, California, where he stayed for one year before returning to New York to begin a professional acting career.</p></section>

        Washington spent the summer of <time datetime="1976">1976</time> in St. Mary&rsquo;s City, Maryland, in summer stock theater performing <em>Wings of the Morning</em>, the Maryland State play, which was written for him by incorporating an African&ndash;American character/narrator based loosely on the historical figure from early colonial Maryland, Mathias de Sousa.</p>
        
       <p>Shortly after graduating from Fordham, Washington made his screen acting debut in the <time datetime="1977">1977</time> made-for-television film Wilma which was a docudrama about sprinter Wilma Rudolph, and made his first Hollywood appearance in the <time datetime="1981">1981</time> film <em>Carbon Copy</em>.

        <p>A major career break came when he starred as Dr. Phillip Chandler in NBC&rsquo;s television hospital drama St. Elsewhere, which ran from <time datetime="1982">1982</time> to <time datetime="1988">1988</time>. He was one of only a few African&ndash;American actors to appear on the series for its entire six&ndash;year run. He also appeared in several television, motion picture and stage roles, such as the films <em>A Soldier&rsquo;s Story</em> <time datetime="1984">(1984)</time>, <em>Hard Lessons</em> <time datetime="1986">(1986)</time> and <em>Power</em> <time datetime="1986">(1986)</time>.

        <h4><time datetime="1990">1990</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1999">1999</time>: Hollywood stardom and acclaim</h4>

        <p>In the summer of <time datetime="1990">1990</time>, Washington had appeared in the title role of the Public Theater&rsquo;s production of William Shakespeare&rsquo;s <em>Richard III</em>. Mel Gussow of <em>The New York Times</em> praised Washington as &quot;an actor of range and intensity, is expert at projecting a feeling of controlled rage&quot;. Also that year Washington starred as Bleek Gilliam in the Spike Lee film Mo&rsquo; <em>Better Blues</em>. Charles Murray of <em>Empire</em> praised Washington&rsquo;s performance as a &quot;taut portrayal of the driven musician&quot; and &quot;like all Lee&rsquo;s film, Mo&rsquo; <em>Better Blues</em> is a real ensemble piece, and the standard of the performances is uniformly excellent: but Washington [and] Lee deserve extra plaudits.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>In <time datetime="1991">1991</time>, he starred as Demetrius Williams in the Mira Nair directed romantic drama <em>Mississippi Masala</em> opposite Sarita Choudhury. Set primarily in rural Mississippi, the film explores interracial romance between African Americans and Indian Americans. Critic Roger Ebert of <em>The Chicago Sun-Times</em> praised the chemistry of the two leads writing, &quot;Washington is an actor of immense and natural charm, and he makes a good match with Sarita Choudhury.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>Washington was reunited with Lee to play one of his most critically acclaimed roles, the title character of the historical epic <em>Malcolm X</em> <time datetime="1992">(1992)</time>. <em>The New York Times</em> gave the film it&rsquo;s Critic&rsquo;s Pick with Vincent Canby declaring, &quot;In Denzel Washington it also has a fine actor who does for &rsquo;Malcolm X&rsquo; what Ben Kingsley did for &rsquo;Gandhi&rsquo;. Mr. Washington not only looks the part, but he also has the psychological heft, the intelligence and the reserve to give the film the dramatic excitement&quot;. His performance as the Black nationalist leader earned him another nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Also that year, he established the production company Mundy Lane Entertainment. The next year, he played the lawyer defending a gay man with AIDS played by Tom Hanks in the Jonathan Demme film <em>Philadelphia</em> <time datetime="1993">1993</time>. <em>Sight & Sound</em> wrote, &quot;Casting Washington in the lead guaranteed the film the black audience that otherwise might not have had much interest in the problems of a rich white homosexual with Aids. But Aids is rampant in inner cities, where it attacks not just gay men, but IV drug users and women.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>During the early and mid&ndash;<time datetime="1990">1990</time>s, Washington starred in several successful thrillers, including <em>The Pelican Brief</em> with Julia Roberts in <time datetime="1993">1993</time>, and <em>Crimson Tide</em> with Gene Hackman in <time datetime="1995">1995</time>, as well as the Shakespearean comedy <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> directed by Kenneth Branagh. In <time datetime="1996">1996</time>, he played a U.S. Army officer who investigates a female chopper commander's worthiness for the Medal of Honor in <em>Courage Under Fire</em>, opposite Meg Ryan. <em>Variety</em> wrote, &quot;All of [the] predicaments are palpably and convincingly registered through Washington&rsquo;s probing, reserved and sensitively drawn performance in a role that, in another era, might have been played by the likes of a Montgomery Clift or William Holden.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>In <time datetime="1996">1996</time>, he appeared with Whitney Houston in the romantic comedy <em>The Preacher&rsquo;s Wife</em>. In <time datetime="1998">1998</time>, Washington starred in Spike Lee&rsquo;s film <em>He Got Game</em>. Washington played a father serving a six&ndash;year prison term when the prison warden offers him a temporary parole to convince his top&ndash;ranked high&ndash;school basketball player son (Ray Allen) to sign with the governor&rsquo;s alma mater, Big State. The film was Washington&rsquo;s third collaboration with Lee. The same year he starred in Gregory Hoblit&rsquo;s supernatural horror film Fallen, with John Goodman, James Gandolfini, and Donald Sutherland.</p>
        
        <p>In <time datetime="1999">1999</time>, Washington starred alongside Angelina Jolie in <em>The Bone Collector</em>. Also in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>, Washington starred in <em>The Hurricane</em>, a film about boxer Rubin &rsquo;Hurricane&rsquo; Carter, whose conviction for triple murder was overturned after he spent almost 20 years in prison. Although less successful at the box office than <em>The Bone Collector</em>, <em>Hurricane</em> had a better reception from critics. He received a Silver Bear Award at the Berlin International Film Festival for his role as Carter. Roger Ebert, film critic for <em>The Chicago Sun&ndash;Times</em>, wrote of Washington&rsquo;s performance, &quot;This is one of Denzel Washington&rsquo;s great performances, on a par with his work in <em>Malcolm X</em>.&quot;</p>
        
        <h4><time datetime="2000">2000</time>&ndash;<time datetime="2009">2009</time>: Established actor and action roles</h4>

        <p>At the 57th Golden Globe Awards in <time datetime="2000">2000</time>, Washington won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor &mdash; Motion Picture Drama for his work in <em>The Hurricane</em>. He was the first black actor to win the award since Sidney Poitier in <time datetime="1963">1963</time>. Mick LaSalle of the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> declared, &quot;Washington gives a penetrating portrait of life at its most extreme. He takes the viewer into the mind of a man experiencing confinement and physical deprivation. More profoundly, he shows what it&rsquo;s like to deal every day with the torments of wild rage and impotence, despair and hope.&quot; In <time datetime="2000">2000</time>, he portrayed Herman Boone, the high school football coach in the Disney sports drama film <em>Remember the Titans</em> which grossed over US$100 million in the U.S. Andrew O&rsquo;Hehir of <em>Salon</em> wrote, &quot;Washington is of course the linchpin of <em>Remember the Titans</em>; he&rsquo;s a commanding actor in a commanding role, and as memorable as he was in <em>The Hurricane</em>.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>Washington starred in the Antoine Fuqua directed crime thriller <em>Training Day</em> <time datetime="2001">(2001)</time> acting opposite Ethan Hawke. He portrayed Detective Alonzo Harris, a corrupt Los Angeles cop. Roger Ebert wrote of his performance, &quot;For Denzel Washington, [its] a rare villainous role; he doesn't look, sound or move like his usual likable characters...he's like a monster from a horror film, unkillable and implacable.&quot; Washington won an Academy Award for Best Actor becoming the second African&ndash;American actor to win the category after Poitier, who was presented with an Honorary Academy Award the same night.He also received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor &mdash; Motion Picture Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.</p>

        <p>In <time datetime="2002">2002</time>, he starred in the Nick Cassavettes directed healthcare&ndash;themed drama John Q. <time datetime="2002">2002</time> portraying John Quincy Archibald. Washington acted opposite James Woods, Robert Duvall, and Ray Liotta. The film was a financial success but received mixed reviews with critics praising Washington&rsquo;s performances. BBC film critic Neil Smith wrote, &quot;What credibility there is comes from Washington&rsquo;s intense, humane performance and the supporting players&rsquo; sterling attempts to rise above the stereotypical roles with which they have been saddled.&quot; That same year Washington directed his first film, a well&ndash;reviewed drama called <em>Antwone Fisher</em> <time datetime="2002">(2002)</time>, in which he also co&ndash;starred as a Navy psychiatrist. Stephen Holden of <em>The New York Times</em> praised his direction writing, &quot;Mr. Washington shows a confident grasp of cinematic narrative in a hearty meat-and-potatoes style. But the most remarkable aspect of his behind&ndash;the&ndash;camera debut is his brilliantly surefooted handling of actors.&quot; He also praised his acting adding, &quot;[He] is so sensitively reactive that his performance seems more lived than acted&quot;.</p>
        
        <p>Between <time datetime="2003">2003</time> and <time datetime="2004">2004</time>, Washington appeared in a series of thrillers that performed generally well at the box office, including Carl Franklin&rsquo;s <em>Out of Time</em> opposite Eva Mendez and Tony Scott&rsquo;s <em>Man on Fire</em> alongside Dakota Fanning. In <time datetime="2004">2004</time> he acted opposite Meryl Streep in the remake of the <time datetime="1962">1962</time> film of the same name, <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em>. In <time datetime="2006">2006</time>, he starred in <em>Inside Man</em>, a Spike Lee&ndash;directed bank heist thriller co&ndash;starring Jodie Foster and Clive Owen. Todd McCarthy of <em>Variety</em> wrote, it&rsquo;s &quot;flashy cast, clever script and vibrant showcasing of New York City are strong plusses for Spike Lee&rsquo;s most mainstream studio venture&quot;. Later that year he starred in the time travel movie <em>Déjà Vu</em> released in November.</p>

        <p>In <time datetime="2005">2005</time>, he was back onstage again as Brutus in a Broadway production of <em>Julius Caesar</em>. Theatre critic Ben Brantley of <em>The New York Times</em> wrote, &quot;Washington does not embarrass himself, as leading citizens of Hollywood have been known to do on Broadway. But even brilliantined in the glow of his inescapable fame, he can&rsquo;t help getting lost amid the wandering, mismatched crowd and the heavy topical artillery that have been assembled here.&quot; Despite mixed reviews, the production&rsquo;s limited run was a consistent sell&ndash;out.</p>
        
        <p>In <time datetime="2007">2007</time>, he co&ndash;starred with Russell Crowe for the second time (the first was <time datetime="1995">1995</time>&rsquo;s <em>Virtuosity</em>) in Ridley Scott&rsquo;s <em>American Gangster</em> for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor &mdash; Motion Picture Drama nomination. He also directed and starred in the drama <em>The Great Debaters</em> with Forest Whitaker. He next appeared in Tony Scott&rsquo;s <time datetime="2009">2009</time> film <em>The Taking of Pelham 123</em> (a remake of the <time datetime="1974">1974</time> thriller of the same name), where he played New York City subway security chief Walter Garber opposite John Travolta&rsquo;s villain.</p>

Ben Brantley of <em>The New York Times</em> wrote, &quot;Mr. Washington has the fluid naturalness we associate with good screen actors... face and stance alone provide fascinating (and damning) glimpses into Troy&rsquo;s attitudes toward his son from an earlier relationships&quot;. Washington won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play on <time datetime="2010-06-13">June 13, 2010</time>.
