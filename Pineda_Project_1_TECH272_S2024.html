<h1>Hector Pineda</h1>

<p>I was born in Silver Spring, Maryland on August 23rd and have lived there ever since up until this past year where I moved to Germantown. I grew up loving computers, video games, and soccer. The first game I ever played was <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> on the NES. Along the way, I had 4 younger sibilings to take care of. </p>

<br>

<p>Currently, I am studying to become a Web Developer while working a part time job at a bookstore. I like to hang out with friends as well as go on dates with my girlfriend. I still enjoy playing video games to this day. Recently, I have been trying to get into Jiu Jitsu but I am having a bit of trouble staying consistant. I am excited to start this class and learn more about <strong>HTML</strong> as well as <strong>CSS</strong></p>

<br>

<p>Ten years from now, I hope to be an excellent and experienced coder. Maybe I can make my own games when I know more about coding. I could be the next <em>Super Cell</em> for mobile games. I hope to have started my own family as well as my own business with good progress by then. I hope to be a wonderful developer but whatever career I end up having in the future, I hope I become a great husband and father for my future family.</p>
